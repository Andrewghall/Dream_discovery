# DREAM Discovery Framework - Competency-Based Structure

## Overview

This discovery framework is designed for 15-minute pre-workshop conversations that assess capability maturity across 5 core competency areas. The conversation is structured to gather insights about current state, what works well, challenges, constraints, future vision, and confidence ratings for each competency.

1. **People**
2. **Corporate / Organisational**
3. **Customer**
4. **Technology**
5. **Regulation / Risk**

### Phase 7: Prioritization (~1 min)

## Intelligent Drilling Techniques

### When to Drill Deeper
- Vague answers → Ask for specific examples
- General statements → Ask for frequency/impact
- Surface-level responses → Ask "Why?" or "What's behind that?"
- Single-word answers → Ask them to expand

### Drilling Techniques
- **Specificity:** "Can you give me a specific example?"
- **Frequency:** "How often does that happen?"
- **Impact:** "What's the impact of that on your work/team/customers?"
- **Context:** "Walk me through what happened the last time..."
- **Causation:** "What causes that?" / "What's behind that?"
- **Scope:** "Who else experiences this?"
- **Attempts:** "What have you tried to address this?"

### When to Move On
- After 2-3 follow-ups on the same point
- When participant gives detailed, specific answer
- When participant says "that's all" or similar
- When minimum insights for phase are captured

## Conversation Flow Principles

### Time Management
- **Intro:** 1 minute
- **Each Competency:** 3 minutes (5 competencies = 15 minutes total)
- **Prioritization:** 1 minute
- **Summary:** 1 minute
- **Total:** ~15 minutes

### Pacing
- If participant is brief, move on quickly
- If participant is detailed, let them talk but gently guide to next area
- Spend ~30-45 seconds per sub-topic within each competency
- Don't force detail if they don't have much to say on a topic

### Transition Phrases
- "Got it, let's move to [next area]..."
- "That's helpful. Next area..."
- "Thanks. Moving on to [next area]..."
- "Let's explore [next competency]..."

### Style
- Warm but focused
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Stay strictly within workshop discovery scope
- Gently redirect if conversation drifts
- Acknowledge responses briefly, then continue discovery
